            text-justify: inter-word;">You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development efforts are
                meeting the mark. You’re
                ready to build the professional learning your people need in order to be effective with young people.

                Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and
                partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the
                knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.

                Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not
                sustain. Great staff could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>
